### <center>Thank you for creating an account at Bosbec. </center>

This test account is valid for one month of free testing. You're also getting some credits that can be used to send messages. 

After your trial period, you will probably want to continue using the service. Your new favorite service will continue to be available for 199 euros per month* + transfer costs for messages. 

A few services will be preinstalled on your account. The services are added to your account and not installed locally on your computer. 


The Bosbec WE platform can be used for many purposes. Use your test period to find out how you prefer to use the WE Platform. 

You can also create completely customized solutions with the Workflow Builder.


To continue using the service after your test period ends, add your credit card information under Settings and Billing.
